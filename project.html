        <h1>Take Me As I Am</h1>
     <p class="projecttext">With this piece I tried to let my emotions just guide where my hand wanted to go.
         It was an attempt to try and heal and let go of the feelings that I carry inside. The colours are slightly inspired by the chakras.
          The lock in the troat area signifies hardships with speaking my truth and that I sometimes feel an acctual block saying my piece.
        The eye inside the gut symbolizes the third eye, mostly located on the forhead, but I feel that our gut feeling is the closest we can come to that spiritual concept.
